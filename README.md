# WEB601_Project
Repository for my WEB601 project

This is my project for the WEB601 course. My app is used to see walking trails in the Nelson region. 
The trails will have information on where it is, the difficulty, how long it will take and the length 
of the trail.

Before running the server, a database will need to be setup of which I have provided MySQL queries to set it up
but the configuration for the database will need to be changed in the config file in MyServer. The configuration 
should be the details of your own database.

How to run my project

Insert these into your terminal
For the server
-cd MyServer
-npm start

Start a second terminal
For the app
-cd WEB601_Project
-npm start

To add a trail from the app, go to the Trail Manager page and then choose Add a New Trail in the dropdown box. If a form 
doesn't appear, change the option and then change it back.
